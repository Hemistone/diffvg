# diffvg runtime requirements (Py3.12 compatible)
#
# Notes
# - Torch GPU wheels depend on a CUDA-tagged index. See the CUDA section below.
# - Pins are set as compatible ranges to work across Linux/macOS with Python 3.12.
# - This file targets the library runtime. Example apps/dev extras are listed at
#   the bottom as commented lines; uncomment as needed.
# - For build-time tools (wheel, scikit-build-core, cmake, etc.), see
#   `requirements-build.txt` and the `[build-system]` section in `pyproject.toml`.
