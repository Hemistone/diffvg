# diffvg runtime requirements (Py3.12 compatible)
#
# Notes
# - Torch GPU wheels depend on a CUDA-tagged index. See the CUDA section below.
# - Pins are set as compatible ranges to work across Linux/macOS with Python 3.12.
# - This file targets the library runtime. Example apps/dev extras are listed at
#   the bottom as commented lines; uncomment as needed.

# Core runtime deps (from pyproject/poetry.lock, modernized for Py3.12)
numpy>=1.26,<3.0
scikit-image>=0.23,<0.25
pillow>=10,<12
matplotlib>=3.8,<3.10
svgpathtools>=1.6,<2.0
cssutils>=2.9,<3.0

# PyTorch (required to use pydiffvg; install matching torchvision)
# By default, the untagged wheels are CPU-only. For GPU wheels, use the CUDA
# index URLs below and keep torch/torchvision versions in sync.
torch>=2.4,<2.6
torchvision>=0.19,<0.21

# --- CUDA wheels guidance (choose ONE block and place it before torch lines) ---
# For CUDA 12.4+ wheels (recommended for CUDA 12.8 toolkits/drivers):
# --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
# For CUDA 12.1 wheels:
# --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
# For CPU-only wheels:
# --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# If you use uv:
#   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# To override index just for torch/torchvision, you can split into two files or
# install those first with the desired index, e.g.:
#   uv pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124 \
#     'torch>=2.4,<2.6' 'torchvision>=0.19,<0.21'
