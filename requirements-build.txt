# Build-time tools for local source builds of diffvg
#
# When using `pip install .`, pip will create an isolated build env and
# install the `[build-system]` requirements listed in `pyproject.toml`.
# Use this file if you prefer to pre-install build tools into your active
# environment (e.g., for `--no-build-isolation` workflows or CI images).

build>=1.2
wheel>=0.42
scikit-build-core>=0.9

# For distutils-based builds (legacy, not recommended) since it is removed after Python 3.12
setuptools

# Notes
# - System toolchains are still required: a C++14 compiler, and for CUDA builds
#   a CUDA Toolkit (12.x recommended) providing `nvcc` and CCCL/Thrust headers.
# - `torch`/`torchvision` are runtime deps and remain in requirements.txt.
